# CS4310 Project 02 - *Let’s Kill It!*

Team members: **Thomas Pickering, Nhat Tran, Celine Mangahas**

## Purpose

Understand the physical and virtual memory management of FreeNOS.

Apply textbook concepts in maintaining a real product.

Get debugging skills.

## Task Description

### Part 1: Git

* [x] Make and check out a branch named “kill”. You will be working on this branch for this project.
* [x] Add GitHub user: “2404s21” as a collaborator.

### Part 2: Write an application named “kill” in folder “FreeNOS-1.0.3\bin\kill”.

* [x] It should work similarly to the kill command that comes with Ubuntu. (In your terminal, do “man kill” to learn more.) You only need to support positive PID and two signals: SIGKILL and SIGTERM.

               # sleep 30 &

               # ps       # suppose the pid for ‘sleep’ is 17

               # kill 17

               # ps       # ‘sleep’ is killed
               
* [x] It should follow the application code structure like the “sleep” command of FreeNOS.

### Part 3: Record a 3-minute (approx..) screencast with your voice (facial image is optional but encouraged)

* [ ] Introduce yourselves;
* [ ] Demo kill a process or two;
* [ ] Show off your contribution to FreeNOS: what you did to get rid of the bug? What debugger did you use?
